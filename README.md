# Detect-and-recognize-vehicle-number-plates
Developed and deployed a machine learning system to detect and recognize vehicle number plates with an accuracy of 92%. Implemented computer vision techniques including Haar cascades, Histogram of Oriented gradients(HOG), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for effective number plate extraction. Utilized optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to accurately read and interpret characters on number plates. Conducted data pre-processing tasks such as cleaning and labeling to ensure high-quality training data trained machine learning models, employing support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests for optimal performance. Evaluated model performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score, and AUC-ROC. Collaborated with project stakeholders, including law enforcement and traffic management, to meet their specific requirements. Contributed to the apprehension of criminals through the system's use in identifying stolen vehicles. Played a key role in the successful deployment and utilization of the system in various practical applications Collaborated with the project manager and software engineer to ensure seamless integration and functionality.
